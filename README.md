This is work in progress, it's incomplete and buggy as hell.

What this aims to be in the future when it's more feature-complete and when it passes some tests:

## +3DOS Disk Management Tool

This tool is a command-line utility for creating, managing, and interacting with virtual disk images in the +3DOS format, commonly used by the ZX Spectrum +3. It allows users to:

- **Create +3DOS Disk Images**: Format virtual disk images with default settings typical of a ZX Spectrum +3 disk.
- **Write Files to Disk**: Add files to the disk image, managing sector allocation and file metadata.
- **List Files**: Display a catalog of files stored in the disk image.
- **Read Files**: Retrieve and read file contents from the virtual disk image.

This tool provides a modern interface for handling +3DOS disk images, useful for retro computing enthusiasts and developers working with ZX Spectrum emulators.
